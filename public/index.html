	<article> A few months ago I started having some..lets call them 'symptoms'. When I know you better, I might even tell you what those 'symptoms' were. <br><br>

	I will tell you though, that as embarrassing as they were, when I stopped panicking and googled them, I discovered they were entirely normal. Why had I never heard of them? and more interestingly, why, if they were entirely normal, was I so embarrassed?<br><br>

	I discovered what I had was the 'peri menopause'. Words I'd only ever seen written down, and then used as an insult my A.A.Gill. <br><br>

	So I started talking to people about the menopause, peri or otherwise. I was amazed by the reaction.<br><br>

	I spoke to doctors and GPs, who told me that week after week they saw women who were utterly unprepared for what was happening to them. They used words like 'conspiracy of silence' and 'taboo'. I spoke to women I knew well and not so well, who told me that they felt alone, that the advice out there didn't speak to them, that they had a feeling of loss that was unexpected, and they also used words like 'taboo' and 'shame'. I also looked at the information that was out there, and while it was useful it didn't resonate with me. <br><br>

	I'm about to hit the menopause, and the kind of information, help and community I want isn't there. So I'm going to build it. <br><br>

	And this is where you come in. You've arrived here by following a link somewhere. This is something that interests you - so I'm asking for a little bit of your time - to let me know what you think about my idea, what information you want, what style of language you want to hear it in, and how you'd like a site and a community to be structured. <br><br>

	You'd be a vanguard for the site and the community I'd like to build, and you can hep hape it by telling me what you think.<br><br>

	If you'd like to be part of this - which involves answering a few emails and telling me what you think, I'd be incredibly grateful. Please fill in your email below and I'll be in touch soon to tell you about next steps. <br><br>
	Thank you
